# Verilog HDL Projects

## ASIC Projects

### 1. FPGA Air Conditioner Controller [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/FPGA-Thermostat-Controller)
- An Air Conditioner Controller Module which displays the room temperature read from the temperature sensor and determines if Air Conditioner or Heater needs to be turned on.  

### 2. RISC V Architecture using verilog [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/RISC-V-Projects) 
- Designed a working 32 Bit RISC-V Architecture with the key components such as Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Arithmetic Logic Unit, SRAM, Data Memory, Control unit.

### 3. Booth's Multiplier Algorithm [link](https://github.com/shreegw/Verilog-and-Projects/tree/main/5.%20Booth's%20Multiplier)
- High Speed Booth's Multiplier that multiplies two 4 bit numbers and gives an 8 bit output. This multiplier can multiply signed and unsigned numbers in 2s complement format. 

### 4. UART Module [link](shreegw/Verilog-Projects/7. UART Module/UART_July8.xpr)
- High Speed UART Module which recieves 1 Byte at a time and displays on the seven segment display. Implemented the project on Nexys4 DDR FPGA Development board equipped with Artix 7 FPGA 

## Hobby Projects

### 3. Full Adder, Ripple Carry Adder, Subtractor [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/Verilog-Projects/tree/main/1.%20Adder%2C%20RCA%2C%20Subtractor)
- An n-Bit Full Adder, Ripple Carry Adder and Subtractor created by cascading half adders with synchronous and asynchronous outputs.  

### 4. Up-Down Counter with 7 Segment Display [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/Verilog-and-Projects/tree/main/2.%20Up-Down%20Counter%20)
- An Up-Down Counter with a clock divider module which can reduce the frequency of FPGA clock to 1Hz connected to a Common Anode 7-Segment Display on the development board.
 
### 5. 16-Bit Pseudo Random Number Generator [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/Verilog-and-Projects/tree/main/3.%2016%20Bit%20LFSR%20PRNG)
- Pseudo Random Number Generator with configurable number of Taps and a maximum period of 2^n^ - 1, where n is number of bits i.e. 16. A PRNG with LFSR is used in casual applications such as Games, temporary verification techniques, etc.

### 6. Hamming (7,4) [ link ](https://github.com/shreegw/Verilog-and-Projects/tree/main/4.%20Hamming%20(7%2C4))
- World's First Error correcting code which can encode 4 bits of data using 3 parity bits and a decoder which has the ability to detect the bit position where the bit flip has happened.  

## Work in Progress 
### 6. Hardware Security Module (Lightweight Trusted Platform Module)(In Progress)
- A smallscale TPM on an FPGA. 

### 7. Cryptography Algorithms(In Progress)
- Cryptography Algorithms such as AES, RSA, SHA using verilog and implementing them on FPGA. 

### 8. Linear Regression using FPGAs (In Progress)
- Implementing Linear regression in FPGA Development
